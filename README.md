DissociatedPress-iOS
====================

An iOS app which uses the [Dissociated Press Algorithm](http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/D/Dissociated-Press.html) to probabilistically generate headlines using Google News as the source text.  


>Dissociated Press uses sophisticated statistical techniques to find hidden patterns in the headlines, then rearranges these patterns to create new, better news:
* Celiac patients meet, Threaten War
* Maryland woman named hero for work on Instagram
* Mark Zuckerberg Invites 30 Million to enter 'deep freeze' as mercury rises
* Review: Depressing new anti-aging medicine
* Satan's Best Productivity Tricks
